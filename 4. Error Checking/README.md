Although these exercises consisted of computing the minimum deceleration required to stop a self-driving car before an obstacle at a fixed distance and the GCD and LCM of two given numbers, its main focus was to error check for different types of input and respond appropriately for each individual case.
<br />

Input  
Braking: 'velocity' 'distance' 'max deceleration' where velocity, distance, max deceleration ∈ [FLOAT_MIN, FLOAT_MAX]

GcdLcm: 'num 1'  'num 2' where num 1, num 2 ∈ [INT_MIN, INT_MAX]

<br />
Key concepts: conditional statements, Euclidean Algorithm
