Although these exercises consisted of computing the minimum deceleration required to stop a self-driving car before an obstacle at a fixed distance and the GCD and LCM of two given numbers, its main focus was to error check for different types of input and respond appropriately for every individual case.

Braking input: 'velocity' 'distance' 'max deceleration' where velocity, distance, max deceleration ∈ [FLOAT_MIN, FLOAT_MAX]

GcdLcm input: 'num 1'  'num 2' where num 1, num 2 ∈ [INT_MIN, INT_MAX]

key concepts: if, else if, and else statements
